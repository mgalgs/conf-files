This is my main grml zsh config. This is an alternative to the main,
full-fledged mgalgs zsh config in `../.zshrc`, which is based on a number
of plugins, and p10k.

To use this grml config, first install the main grml zsh config:

    wget -O ~/.zshrc https://grml.org/console/zshrc

then install the customizations:

    cp -vi ~/conf-files/grml/.zshrc.local ~/
